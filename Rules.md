# BNB Rules

## Setup:
    1. For setup you have 2 options:
        - Use the random selection
        - Use the solution tools to select cards
            1 of each Scenario Cards:
                - Initial Compromise
                - Pivot
                - C2
                - Persist
            4-6 Establish Procedure cards
    2. Next the DM creates a story base off the 4 scenario cards.
    3. Finally, the DM takes a screenshot of the solution area and keeps it hidden.

## Game Play:
    1. The DM read the story to the group
    2. Next the group will have 10 turns to try and figure out all 4 scenario cards

## Player Turn:
    1. Each turn the group will talk and can ask questions to the DM to get clarity on the current story situation.
    2. Afterwards the group will pick 1 card from the available procedures.
    3. Then 1 of the players from the group will roll a d20 to see if that procedure was successful. To be successful, the players will need to roll a 11 or better, please see d20 Rules for more information.
    4. If that procedure was successful the DM will look to see if any of the scenario card is affected by the procedure card that was selected. 
       - If 1 or more card is affected by the procedure card, the DM choose which scenario card to reveal.
    5. Finally, that procedure card will need to cool-down for the next 3 turns, regardless of the d20 outcome.
